In this supplementary, we give a brief introduction of following coefficients that measure
the similarity between two gene sets based on gene overlaps: [Jaccard coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), [Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), [overlap coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient) and [kappa coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa).


Denote two sets of genes as $A$ and $B$, the
Jaccard coeffcient between the two sets is calculated as:

$${|A \cap B|}\over{|A \cup B|}$$

The Dice coeffcient is calculated as:

$$\frac{|A \cap B|}{(|A| + |B|)/2}$$

Jaccard coefficient has a relationship with Dice coefficient in the form of:

$$Jaccard = \frac{Dice}{2 - Dice}$$

The overlap coeffcient is calculated as:

$$\frac{| A \cap B | }{\min(|A|,|B|)}$$

The symbol $|A|$ means the size of set $A$ (number of elements).

The definition of kappa coeffient is a little bit complex. First let's format the two sets
into a contigency table:

<style>
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
th, td {
	padding: 2px 5px;
}
.symbol {
	font-family: Times;
	font-style: italic;
}
</style>
<center>
<table>
	<tr><td rowspan='2' colspan='2'></td><td colspan='2'>In set <b>B</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan='2'>In set <b>A</b></td><td>Yes</td><td class="symbol">a</td><td class="symbol">b</td></tr>
	<tr><td>No</td><td class="symbol">c</td><td class="symbol">d</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are the numbers of genes that fall in each category.

Let's calculate $p_o$ and $p_e$ as: 

$$p_o = \frac{a+d}{a+b+c+d}$$

$$p_{Yes} = \frac{a+b}{a+b+c+d} \cdot \frac{a+c}{a+b+c+d}$$

$$p_{No} = \frac{c+d}{a+b+c+d} \cdot \frac{b+d}{a+b+c+d}$$

$$p_e = p_{Yes} + p_{No}$$

where $p_o$ is the probability of a gene in both gene sets or neither in the two sets,
$p_{Yes}$ is the probability of a gene in both gene sets by random (by assuming the events of a gene in set $A$ and set $B$ are independent), $p_{No}$ is the probability of a gene
not in the two sets by random, and $p_e$ is the probability of a gene either both in 
the two sets or not in the two sets by random.

and the kappa coeffcient is calculated as:

$$\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$
